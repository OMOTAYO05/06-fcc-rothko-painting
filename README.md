# 06-Fcc-Rothko-Painiting

> A CSS Webpage built with HTML5 and CSS

![06-fcc-rothko-painting](./app_screenshot.png)

It's a project, that I used CSS and HTML5 to learn about box model, spacing, border, padding and others elements.

## Built With

- HTML5
  - `div`:used to group block-level content and structure an HTML document.
- CSS
  - `spacing`:Its adjusts the space between words in an element
  - `border`: its property is used to define the outline of an element
  - `padding`: its is used to create space around an element's content, inside any defined borders
  - `background-color`:is used to set the background color of an element.
- Linters
  - [Prettier](https://prettier.io/),
  - [Stylelint](https://stylelint.io/),
- Github Action

### Development (Running locally)

- Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OMOTAYO05/html-css-template.git

```

- Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

To run StyleLint by itself, you may run the lint task:

```bash
yarn lint:check
```

Or to automatically fix issues found (where possible):

```bash
yarn lint
```

You can also check against Prettier:

```bash
yarn format:check
```

and to have it fix (to the best of its ability) any format issues, run:

```bash
yarn format
```

You can also check against HTML Validator (htmlhint):

```bash
yarn lint:html
```

To generate an accessibility report for this webpage, run the below command, it uses axe:

```bash
yarn axe
```
